# #indows

apps are launched by pressing windows and typing. Apps can be lauched with sudo-like power by windows by pressing right then tapping down to hit open with admin rights.

start:
 - install chocolatey from their website
 - `choco install vscode`
 - `choco install spotify`


Terminal:

Stable: Use WSL, this creates an install of ubuntu 	


### Keyboard mastery:

 - alt-f4 seems unreliable in powershell

 - Pressing alt solo will switch your seelction to the window's menubar
 - Control is often used as a modifier

- windows + directions is used for moving a window around

- windows + tab = expose + recent files (it's too slow to really use though, even on a fresh computer )

The taskbar defaults aren't really recommended by anyone:
 - right click to get to settings
 - remove search, cortana, 
 - remove extra icons like IE, store etc by ricght clicking and unpinning
